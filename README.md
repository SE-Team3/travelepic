## TravelEpic

(Under Development) A one stop destination to make the perfect itinerary to plan your trips with friends and families.

TravelEpic mainly focuses on bringing together a single point of contact for multiple like-minded travelers. A travel group, which has many users under it will have a chat feature among its subordinate members. The Trip-planning feature can be used to plan outings to common places of interest.

During the trip, the individual users get notified about common Places of Interest which are nearing or have already arrived. Restaurants and Hotels are also suggested based on the timings of these places as compared to the current time of the day during the trip.

Best routes are computed and suggested for the individual users based on factors such as traffic, present conditions of roads i.e. lack of asphalt on the road, minimal number of potholes, least number of curves.

The Google Maps API has been extensively used to complete the offered functionality of the app. Constant Location-tracking and timely updates among the users in a particular group are shared among updates
